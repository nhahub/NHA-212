## About the Project

YumifyPlus is a full-stack web application I built to make ordering food easier for customers while giving restaurant owners tools to manage their business. Customers can browse menus, place orders, track deliveries, and leave reviews. Restaurant owners get a dashboard with analytics, order management, inventory tracking, and staff management.

### What It Does

For customers, it simplifies the whole ordering process. You can browse different restaurants, add items to your cart, choose how you want to pay, and then track your order in real-time as it goes from "preparing" to "on the way" to "delivered". There's also an AI chatbot that can help answer questions about the menu.

For restaurant owners, it's basically an all-in-one management system. You can see how your restaurant is performing with charts and stats, manage incoming orders and update their status, add or remove items from your menu, manage your staff, and see what customers are saying in reviews.

### Who It's For

- **Customers**: Anyone who wants an easier way to order food and track deliveries
- **Restaurant Owners**: Business owners who need a simple platform to manage orders, menu, inventory, and staff

### Why It's Useful

- Built with modern tech (React 19, Node.js, MongoDB) so it's fast and reliable
- Has an AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini that can actually help customers
- Restaurant owners get real-time analytics to see what's working
- Multiple payment options (cards, cash, e-wallets)
- Dark mode because why not
- Works on phones, tablets, and computers

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** - Comes with Node.js (or you can use yarn)
- **MongoDB Atlas account** - [Sign up here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (or run MongoDB locally)
- **Google Gemini API Key** - [Get one here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (needed for the chatbot)
- **Email service** - Gmail or another SMTP service (for sending verification emails)

---

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "Final Project Repo - VIP"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the backend dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

Then install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd client-side
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (same level as `package.json`). Here's what to put in it:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Secret (make this a long random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_minimum_32_characters

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Email Configuration (Gmail example)
EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_specific_password

# Google Gemini API (for chatbot)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-lite
```

### Step 4: Start the Servers

You'll need two terminal windows open.

**Terminal 1 - Start the backend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

**Terminal 2 - Start the frontend:**
```bash
cd client-side
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app.

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

The frontend is deployed on Vercel: [https://yumif-yplus.vercel.app](https://yumify-plus.vercel.app)

To deploy yourself:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set these build settings:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Root Directory: `client-side`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend URL (like `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api`)

### Backend (Render / Railway / Heroku)

For the backend, you can deploy to Render, Railway, Heroku, or any Node.js hosting:

1. Before deploying, make sure your `.env` has:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `FRONTEND_URL` set to your production frontend URL
   - All other variables configured

2. On Render (example):
   - Connect your repo
   - Set root directory to the project root
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - Add all your environment variables

3. Important things to remember:
   - Make sure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from your hosting provider's IP (or just allow all IPs)
   - Update CORS settings to allow your production frontend URL
   - Use a strong JWT secret in production
   - Set up your email service for production

## Usage Guide

### For Customers

1. **Sign up or log in**: Create an account or use your existing one
2. **Browse the menu**: Check out what different restaurants are offering
3. **Add to cart**: Pick items you want and add them to your cart
4. **Checkout**: Review your order, pick a payment method, and place the order
5. **Track your order**: Watch as your order status updates from "preparing" to "on the way" to "delivered"
6. **Leave a review**: After you get your food, rate it and leave feedback

### For Restaurant Owners

1. **Sign up as owner**: When you register, choose "owner" as your role. A restaurant will be created automatically for you.
2. **Go to dashboard**: You'll see analytics, revenue stats, and recent orders
3. **Manage your menu**: Add new items, edit existing ones, upload images, mark items as unavailable
4. **Handle orders**: See incoming orders and update their status as you work through them
5. **Manage staff**: Add staff members and assign them roles
6. **Check feedback**: See what customers are saying in their reviews

### How It All Works

**Customer order flow**: Add items to cart → Go to checkout → Pick payment method → Place order → Track status → Get delivery → Leave review

**Owner workflow**: Dashboard → See new orders → Confirm orders → Mark as preparing → Mark as ready → Update delivery status → View analytics

---

## Authentication & Security

### How Authentication Works

We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. When you log in, you get a token that's stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie. This token expires after 12 hours (you can change this if you want).

### Security Features

- **Password hashing**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before being stored. We never store plain text passwords.
- **Protected routes**: Some pages require you to be logged in. The frontend checks this and redirects you to login if needed.
- **API protection**: Protected API endpoints check for a valid token before allowing access.
- **CORS**: We've configured CORS to only allow requests from approved origins.
- **Environment variables**: All sensitive data (API keys, secrets, etc.) are stored in `.env` files that aren't committed to git.
- **Email verification**: We verify email addresses when you sign up.
- **Password reset**: If you forget your password, we send you a secure reset link via email.

### Best Practices

- Never commit `.env` files to git
- Use a strong, unique JWT secret (different for development and production)
- Keep your dependencies updated
- Always validate user inputs on both frontend and backend
- Use HTTPS in production (never HTTP)

## Features in Detail

### AI Chatbot

The chatbot is powered by Google Gemini and can actually help customers. It knows about the menu, can answer questions about orders, and maintains conversation context so it remembers what you've talked about. There's rate limiting to prevent abuse, and it's set up to give accurate recommendations based on what's actually on the menu.

You can find the chatbot component in `client-side/src/components/Chatbot.jsx` and the API endpoint in `server-side/routes/chatbot.route.js`.

### Order Tracking

Orders go through these statuses:
1. **Pending** - Just placed, waiting for restaurant to confirm
2. **Confirmed** - Restaurant confirmed they got it
3. **Preparing** - Restaurant is cooking your food
4. **Ready** - Food is ready for pickup/delivery
5. **On the Way** - Driver is bringing it to you
6. **Delivered** - You got it!
7. **Cancelled** - Order was cancelled

The system also handles orders with items from multiple restaurants - each restaurant's items are tracked separately.

### Payment Methods

You can pay in three ways:
1. **Credit/Debit Card**: Standard card processing
2. **Cash on Delivery**: Pay when the food arrives
3. **E-Wallets**: Vodafone Cash, Orange Cash, Etisalat Cash, WePay, or Fawry

### Dashboard Analytics

The owner dashboard shows:
- Revenue trends with different chart types (bar charts, area charts, etc.)
- Order statistics (how many total, pending, completed)
- Low stock alerts (warns you when items are running out)
- Recent orders at a glance
- Visual charts using Sparkline, Donut, and Bar chart components
